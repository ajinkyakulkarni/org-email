org-email is a way of acknowledging that people store emails in org
databases.

Here is how I store mine:

{{{
* bill the buck
** email
*** billbuck@example1.com
** partner
*** Gillie The Girl
* lesley lady
** colleague @ woomedia
*** CSS programmer
** partner
*** Jimmy Screws
** email
*** ll@example10.org
}}}

org-email offers a simple interface to use completion to insert the
correct email address of a person in such a database.
